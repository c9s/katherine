# Delivery

Continuous Meteor Deployment Integration bases on Typeloy <https://github.com/c9s/typeloy>

Typeloy is a re-written development tool from "mup" with TypeScript 2.0. In order to make Typeloy to be easy to be integrated with other applications,
we refactored Typeloy with a nice action API.

And therefore, **Delivery** can use Typeloy API to ship the softwares to the target servers.
